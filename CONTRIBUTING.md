# Contributing to TermUI

Thanks for your contribution. Bug fixes, new widgets, improved docs, typo fixes. All of it helps.

> 🎯 **GSSoC 2026 contributors:** jump to the [GSSoC section](#gssoc-2026) below. Read it before you open any PR.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Karanjot786/TermUI.git
cd TermUI
bun install
bun run build
bun run test
```

You need **Bun 1.3 or newer**. The project is a Bun workspace monorepo with 13 packages under `packages/`. Node 18+ matters only if you consume published `@termuijs/*` packages from npm. Development is Bun-only.

## Two-repo layout

Framework code lives here. Docs site lives in a separate repo.

| Repo | Contents | Where to send your PR |
|------|----------|------------------------|
| **TermUI** (this repo) | 13 packages, examples, tests, scaffolding CLI | Bug fixes, new widgets, hooks, refactors, tests |
| **TermUI_Docs** | [termui.io](https://www.termui.io) source: Vite + TanStack + MDX content | Doc typos, new doc pages, website UI changes |

[TermUI_Docs on GitHub](https://github.com/Karanjot786/TermUI_Docs). GSSoC 2026 counts only on **this** repo; the docs repo does not participate.

API docs for each package live on https://www.termui.io. Edit those pages in [TermUI_Docs](https://github.com/Karanjot786/TermUI_Docs).

## Before you write code

1. **Check existing issues.** Someone might already work on it.
2. **Open an issue first** for anything larger than a small fix. Describe your change and your reason. Saves everyone time if the approach needs discussion.
3. **One pull request per change.** Do not bundle unrelated fixes.

## Writing code

### Style

- TypeScript strict mode. No `any` without an inline comment explaining why.
- No external runtime dependencies in `@termuijs/core`. The core stays dependency-free.
- Use `node:` prefix for built-in modules. Example: `import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs'`.
- Every state-mutating method on a widget calls `this.markDirty()`.

### Tests

Every package uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). Tests live next to source files. Example: `foo.ts` plus `foo.test.ts`.

```bash
# Run all tests
bun run test

# Run tests for a single package
bun vitest run packages/core

# Run a single test file
bun vitest run packages/widgets/src/data/Gauge.test.ts

# Watch mode
bun run test:watch
```

Add a test when you add a widget or fix a bug. Look at existing tests in the same package for patterns.

### Building

```bash
# Build all packages
bun run build

# Build a single package
cd packages/core && bun run build
```

Each package uses tsup. Output goes to `dist/` with both ESM and CJS formats. Published artifacts run on Node 18+ and Bun.

## Pull request process

1. Fork the repo. Create a branch from `main`. Branch name: `type/short-description`. Example: `fix/empty-list-crash`.
2. **⭐ Star the repo** before you open your PR. The `star-check` job fails otherwise.
3. Make your changes.
4. Run `bun run build && bun run test && bun run typecheck`. All three pass.
5. Write your PR title in the form `type: short description`. Example: `fix: handle empty list in VirtualList`.
6. Link your issue: `Closes #123` in the PR body.

You get a review within 48 hours. Small PRs review faster.

## What reviewers look for

- **Does it break existing tests?** A failing `bun run test` blocks merge.
- **Is there a test for your change?** Bug fixes need a test that would have caught the bug. New features need happy-path coverage and one edge case.
- **Does it match existing style?** Read a few files in the same package first.
- **Are there `markDirty()` calls?** Any widget method you write that changes visible state calls `markDirty()`.
- **Is your commit message clear?** Use: `fix(core): prevent layout overflow on zero-width box` or `feat(widgets): add BarChart widget`.

## Commit / PR title format

```
type(scope): short description

Longer explanation if needed.

Fixes #123
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`, `a11y`, `ci`, `build`, `security`

**Scopes:** `core`, `widgets`, `ui`, `jsx`, `store`, `tss`, `router`, `motion`, `data`, `testing`, `dev-server`, `quick`, `create-termui-app`, `examples` (the `website` scope lives in the separate [TermUI_Docs](https://github.com/Karanjot786/TermUI_Docs) repo)

The CI workflow auto-applies a `type:*` label from your PR title prefix. The label counts toward your GSSoC points.

## Adding a new widget

1. Create your file in the right package. `packages/widgets/src/` for base widgets. `packages/ui/src/` for compound widgets.
2. Extend the `Widget` base class from `@termuijs/core`.
3. Implement `_renderSelf(screen: Screen)`.
4. Call `this.markDirty()` in every method you write that changes visual state.
5. Add a `caps.unicode` fallback if you use non-ASCII characters.
6. Add a `caps.motion` guard if your widget animates.
7. Export from the package's `index.ts`.
8. Add tests. See `packages/widgets/src/data/Gauge.test.ts` for the pattern.
9. Add a doc page. The doc site lives in a separate repo: [TermUI_Docs](https://github.com/Karanjot786/TermUI_Docs). Create your MDX in `src/content/`. Register it in `src/content/pages.ts`. Open the PR there.

## Adding a new theme

1. Create your `.tss` file in `packages/tss/src/themes/`.
2. Add the theme name to `BUILTIN_THEMES` in `packages/tss/src/themes/index.ts`.
3. Update the theme count in `packages/tss/package.json` and `packages/tss/README.md`.
4. Update the TSS docs page.

# GSSoC 2026

TermUI participates in **GSSoC 2026**. Contribution window: 15 May to 14 August 2026. Below are the rules. Follow them to earn points.

## Step 1: star the repo

This is **required**. PRs from contributors who do not star the repo fail the `star-check` job. The bot comments a reminder.

Star the repo, push any commit (or re-run the workflow), and the `needs-star` label lifts automatically.

## Step 2: pick a good first issue

Browse [open good-first-issues](https://github.com/Karanjot786/TermUI/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

Claim one. Comment:

> I would like to work on this

The bot assigns you. You have **7 days** to open your PR. After that the issue frees up.

## Step 3: open your PR

1. Branch name: `type/short-description`.
2. PR title: `type: short description`.
3. Link your issue in the body: `Closes #N`.
4. Fill in the PR template. Every section.
5. All checks pass: `build`, `test`, `typecheck`, `star-check`, `auto-label`.

## Step 4: how points work

Every approved PR earns points from labels. Your reviewer sets `gssoc:approved` plus `level:*` plus `quality:*` after review. `type:*` auto-applies from your PR title.

| Label | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `gssoc:approved` | +50 base points. Required for any credit. |
| `level:beginner` | +20 difficulty |
| `level:intermediate` | +35 difficulty |
| `level:advanced` | +55 difficulty |
| `level:critical` | +80 difficulty |
| `quality:clean` | x 1.2 multiplier |
| `quality:exceptional` | x 1.5 multiplier |
| `type:docs` | +5 |
| `type:bug`, `type:feature`, `type:testing`, `type:design`, `type:refactor` | +10 |
| `type:accessibility`, `type:performance`, `type:devops` | +15 |
| `type:security` | +20 |

**Formula:** `50 + (difficulty x quality_multiplier) + type_bonus`

**Example:** `gssoc:approved` + `level:intermediate` + `quality:clean` + `type:feature` = `50 + (35 x 1.2) + 10 = 102 pts`.

## Step 5: avoid disqualification

These labels mean **zero points** and lead to disqualification:

- `gssoc:invalid`. Your PR violates rules. Example: no linked issue, broken build, no tests, missing template fields.
- `gssoc:spam`. Duplicate, low-effort, or trivial change.
- `gssoc:ai-slop`. Generated content with no real engagement. Broken code or fabricated reasoning.

**Do not:**
- Submit a PR without claiming the issue first.
- Open multiple PRs for the same issue.
- Use AI to generate code you do not understand.
- Open PRs that only change whitespace or comments.
- Bundle unrelated changes.

**Do:**
- Engage with mentor feedback.
- Test your code locally before you open your PR.
- Read the existing code in your area.
- Ask questions on the [GSSoC Discord](https://gssoc.girlscript.org/getting-started) when stuck.

## Reaching your mentor

- **Quick questions:** GSSoC Discord, project channel, tag `@Karanjot786`.
- **PR-specific questions:** comment on your PR with the exact line and error.
- **Long-form or career:** LinkedIn.

Format your question: *"Hi, I am stuck on issue #42. Tried approach Y. Got error Z."* Specific question = fast answer. "I'm stuck" = no answer.

## Weekly rhythm

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Monday** | Pick one issue you finish this week. Claim it. |
| **Wednesday** | Open your PR. Ping your mentor if stuck. |
| **Sunday** | Check your rank on the GSSoC leaderboard. Plan next week. |

## Questions?

Open an issue or start a discussion. No question is stupid. The codebase has 13 packages and a lot of moving parts. Ask first, guess later.
